# Lemmas and Facts
A collection of useful lemmas and math facts for problem solving and proof writing

## Goals

1. Precise
    + every proof should only use generally accepted math notation
    + notation encodes structure, words express intent
    + logic must be obvious and completely unambiguous

2. Scalable
    + code reuse in encouraged
    + project structure should support future stylistic changes
    + adding new entries should be frictionless

3. Readable
    + prefer linear reasoning
    + lemmas can refer to other lemmas sparingly, only when there is no shorter way to express intent; you should avoid long chains
